## How It Works

1. **Frontend:**  
   The React frontend provides a form to add new passwords and displays all saved credentials in a table. Each entry can be copied, edited, or deleted. Passwords are masked for security.

2. **Backend:**  
   The Express.js backend exposes three main endpoints:
   - `GET /` ‚Äî Fetch all saved passwords.
   - `POST /` ‚Äî Add a new password.
   - `DELETE /` ‚Äî Delete a password by its ID.

   The backend uses MongoDB to persist all password data.

3. **Clipboard Copy:**  
   Click the copy icon next to any field to copy its value to your clipboard, with a toast notification for feedback.

4. **Password Visibility:**  
   Click the eye icon to toggle password visibility when entering a new password.
